## Hate Speech Detection with Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for a project on hate speech detection using machine learning.

### Project Description
Hate speech is a serious problem online, causing harm and creating hostile environments. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to automatically detect hate speech in text data.

### Getting Started
This project requires Python 3 and several libraries. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

> #### Bash
> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> Use code with caution.


> Note: Make sure you have the necessary libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch installed based on the chosen framework.

### Data
The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to size or privacy concerns. You can find information about obtaining a suitable dataset for hate speech detection online.

### Usage
> 1.Clone this repository:
> Bash
> `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hate-speech-detection.git`
> Use code with caution.
> 2. Navigate to the project directory:
> Bash
> `cd hate-speech-detection`
> Use code with caution.
